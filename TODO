- \repeat and \bar are not native functions (but user) (at least           DONE
  \repeat, not sure about \bar)

- the statements queue should be a ring array, not a linked list

- loop statement re-insertion: please ensure that the same context is
  reused (not recreated); one way is to make the context itself a
  statement and insert it instead of the initial loop
